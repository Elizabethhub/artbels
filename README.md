# Hello Node!

This project includes a Node.js server script and a web page that connects to it. The front-end page presents a form the visitor can use to submit a color name, sending the submitted value to the back-end API running on the server. 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is a popular runtime that lets you run server-side JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

You'll get best use out of this project if you're familiar with basic JavaScript. If you've written JavaScript for client-side web pages this is a little different because it uses server-side JS, but the syntax is the same!

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `public/style.css`: The styling rules for the pages in your site.

‚Üê `server.js`: The **Node.js** server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end.

‚Üê `package.json`: The NPM packages for your project's dependencies.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder holds the site template along with some basic data files.
